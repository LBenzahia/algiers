### Nodeschool Meeting #1: CSE-ESI 26th April, 2016

**What is Nodeschool ?**

A home for a collection of open source workshops to teach you about Javascript specifically and web skills generally.

**Why Nodeschool ?**

Well, Nodeschool does it the direct way, so instead of spending time reading articles with too much of theory and less practice.
Nodeschool gives you just the practical materials  so you can enjoy the journey when learning new web -related skills.

**How to Nodeschool ?**

Getting started with Nodeschool workshops is very easy and straightforward.
First make sure you have Git, Node.js and NPM(Node package Manager) installed on your machine.
Second select which workshop(s) you want to start from the official website, install them and have fun while learning.

**Notes :**

* Nodeschool workshops are terminal-based(cmd in windows), so knowing the basics(opening and closing files commands ...etc) of shell scripting is essential.
* It is a fact that windows terminal  is less powerful compared to the linux-based ones therefore I encourage you to install those workshops on a Linux or a Mac machine to avoid all the problems that you may encounter while using windows. 
That been said if you want to use windows it is your choice and I hope you won't get weird error messages.

**Required tools :**
* [git official website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) (to install git, a version control system).
* [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (to install install Node.js installer alongside npm).
* [Nodeschool website](http://nodeschool.io/) (to choose and install Nodeschool workshops).
